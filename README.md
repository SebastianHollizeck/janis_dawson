# janis_dawson

This is a repository for workflows and their respective tools, which are developed in the dawson lab, but are an extension to [Janis](https://github.com/PMCC-BioinformaticsCore/janis).


You can see a full list of tools in the janis repo [documentation](https://janis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tools/bioinformatics/index.html).


## Workflows
Every workflow we are working on and trying out. The idea here is to make them easily publishable and reproducible.

## Tools
Tools are programs in a containerised way and should only be in this repo, if they are either not ready to be published yet, or part of a workflow, which isn't ready to be published yet. The goal is to make them available in the main Janis repo, if they are widely used, or another public version of this repo.
